"""Computes how many divsteps iterations are needed for inputs in a given range.

Invoke as:
  python3 divsteps_iters.py [--half-delta] <M>

(or using pypy3, which is significantly faster)

for some integer M > 0. The program will then report the number of iterations
needed for any f and g for which 0 <= g <= f <= M.
